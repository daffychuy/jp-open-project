# JAP Dictionary Project
A japanese to other language (Currently English) dictionary aimed to be available on all platform with the ability on mobile to use image text recognition.

## Why this project?
This is a project inspired from personal use of other dictionary app where while they do a good job of word searching, sometimes reading something you'd want to use a camera to grab the word and translate it for you. That's the main intuition behind the project idea.

## How to run in production
By using Docker, we provide `docker-compose up --build`
- Which installs all dependencies in go, setup database and populate data

## To run during testing
Using `air` you can run the application in development mode while supporting live reload. It is what I recommend you use.

## Who is this for?
Anyone who would use a dictionary for Japanese
