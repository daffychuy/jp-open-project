# Japanese open soruce dictionary project
A japanese to other language (Currently English) dictionary aimed to be available on all platform with the ability on mobile to use image text recognition.

## Why this project?
This is a project inspired from personal use of other dictionary app where while they do a good job of word searching, sometimes reading something you'd want to use a camera to grab the word and translate it for you.
That's the main intuition behind the project idea. 

## Who is this for?
Anyone who would use a dictionary for Japanese
